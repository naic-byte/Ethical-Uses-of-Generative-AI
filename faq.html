                        Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. It can learn human language, programming languages, art, chemistry, biology, or any complex subject matter. It reuses what it knows to solve new problems. For example, it can learn English vocabulary and create a poem from the words it processes. Your organization can use generative AI for various purposes, like chatbots, media creation, product development, and design.

                        GenAI works through using algorithms to learn from vast amounts of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This is a process of continuous learning, where the AI's models are trained on data, and then refined through feedback loops to improve accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed for every single scenario.

                        Generative AI (GenAI) excels at creating new, original content, automating time-consuming tasks, and analyzing large volumes of data to provide insights, thereby significantly boosting human productivity and creativity across various industries. Common use cases include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Diverse outputs</b>: GenAI can produce what seems like diverse and original outputs. It can create content through capturing nuances in language, based on patterns which we may not have seen before in the data they were trained on. This helps to open up different perspectives and can give us ideas on how to explore topics from a variety of viewpoints.</li>
                            <li><b>Levelling the playing field</b>: Gen AI can process and interpret human language in a conversational style, which allows it to generate contextually relevant responses to user prompts. It can also reformulate text to simplify or summarise it, which can help people start to understand more complex ideas. Gen AI can also process and generate text in multiple languages.</li>
                            <li><b>Organisational productivity</b>: Gen AI can be fine-tuned for different domains, so it can be made widely available for a variety of tasks. Some examples include chatbots, content generation and language translation. This can help boost organisational productivity. Gen AI can answer questions in a human-like style, reduce effort on tedious and monotonous tasks, provide accessible summaries of complex topics, produce automatic translations and transcriptions, etc.</li>
                            <li><b>Personalisation</b>: Gen AI models can remember previous interactions, which results in more coherent and relevant conversation experiences for users. You can ask some models to remember your writing style or how you want to present your data. You can even ask a chat tool to test your knowledge against any piece of content. Gen AI can generate quick responses, which produces rapid interactions and real-time applications.</li>
                            <li><b>Industry applications</b>: It is anticipated that most industry and workplaces will be using a form of Generative AI in the future to enhance and optimise their work. Gen AI is already integrating into our daily learning and work tools, such as Copilot within Microsoft Office, or the AI content generator in Grammarly. So it is important to develop your skills in using Gen AI effectively and ethically.</li>

                        Generative AI risks fall into several broad categories: functional, operational and legal.
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Functional risks</b>: The ongoing usefulness of an organization's AI tools is threatened by functional risks. Model drift and data poisoning are two major functional hazards.

                            When a model gradually loses alignment with the space it was taught to assist, this is known as model drift. Retraining the model on updated data is necessary to fix this issue, but it can be expensive and time-consuming.

                            When a hostile nation-state or commercial rival taints the data stream used to train a model, this is known as "data poisoning." A pre-released training cycle or a model that self-modifies using input from production data could be contaminated by adversaries.</li>
                            <li><b>Operational risks</b>: Operational risks are those that could impair a business's capacity to operate.

                            The dangers of employing the output of a poisoned model or heeding faulty AI-generated recommendations are partly caused by the misdirection and consequent resource waste.  Additionally, there is the problem of squandering funds that could have been used for more sensible tactics, which leads to lost opportunities.

                            Unwanted exposure of private intellectual property is another issue.  Malicious actors could cause generative AI tools to reveal private information by carefully crafting prompts.  Such leaks have the potential to expose trade secrets and undermine competitive advantages.</li>
                            <li><b>Legal risks</b>: When an organization uses generative AI, it runs the danger of being sued in both civil and criminal court.

                            Confabulation may result in these legal issues, such as when a consumer is hurt by inaccurate information provided by an organization's AI tool.  When AI systems evaluate documents like loan applications and resumes, biases can result in penalties, fines, lawsuits, and reputational harm for the companies involved.

                            Another concern for users of generative AI systems is copyright infringement.  Copyrighted works may be included in an LLM's training data, and it is currently unclear if replies based on such data constitute copyright infringement.  Similarly, companies may face legal action, fines, and reputational harm if generative AI algorithms reveal personally identifying information.</li>

                </h3>
                <div id="collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSix" data-bs-parent="#genaiFaqs">
                    <div class="accordion-body text-light">
                       <b>NO</b>, you cannot blindly trust Generative AI (GenAI) for research accuracy. GenAI models are designed to generate plausible-sounding content based on patterns in their training data, not to verify facts, which often leads to inaccuracies known as "hallucinations". Human oversight and critical evaluation are essential when using GenAI for any work requiring factual correctness.

                    <div class="accordion-body text-light">
                        Whether your data and prompt history are private depends entirely on the specific AI service you are using and its terms of service and privacy policy. In general, public AI platforms often collect and use user inputs to train and improve their models, meaning they are not entirely private by default. However, some services offer options for enhanced privacy, such as not storing prompts or using end-to-end encryption. Always review the privacy settings and policies of the AI tool you are using to understand how your data is handled.

                       Safety guardrails in generative AI are a set of controls that prevent AI models from producing harmful, biased, or inaccurate outputs. These guardrails are built into different stages of the AI pipeline and include technical measures to block attacks, ethical filters to block inappropriate content, and operational rules to ensure legal and brand compliance. Examples include filtering out hate speech, protecting personal information, and preventing the model from going off-topic or providing dangerous advice.
